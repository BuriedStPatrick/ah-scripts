# AutoHotkey Scripts

These are a bunch of AutoHotkey scripts I use for making the Windows keyboard experience slightly less dreadful.

## Bindings

| Binding    | Description                          |
|------------|--------------------------------------|
| Win+Enter  | Launch Windows Terminal              |
| Win+Y      | Launch YouTube Music                 |
| Win+B      | Launch MS Edge with Personal Profile |
| Win+Ctrl+B | Launch MS Edge with Work Profile     |
| Win+Q      | Quit any program (Runs Alt+F4)       |
| Win+W      | Same as Win+Q                        |
| Ctrl+Q     | Same as Win+Q                        |
| Win+T      | Launch taskmgr                       |
| Win+S      | Launch Slack.                        |


Futhermore, all `Win+<number>` key combinations are disabled. Who even uses this??
