# AutoHotkey Scripts

These are a bunch of AutoHotkey scripts I use for making the Windows keyboard experience slightly less dreadful.

## Bindings

| Binding    | Description                          |
|------------|--------------------------------------|
| Win+Enter  | Launch Windows Terminal              |
| Win+Y      | Launch YouTube Music                 |
| Win+B      | Launch MS Edge with Personal Profile |
| Win+Ctrl+B | Launch MS Edge with Work Profile     |
| Win+M      | Launch Messenger in MS Edge app      |
| Win+C      | Launch Google Calendar (Personal)    |
| Win+Ctrl+C | Launch Google Calendar (Work)        |
| Win+Q      | Quit any program (Runs Alt+F4)       |
| Win+W      | Same as Win+Q                        |
| Ctrl+Q     | Same as Win+Q                        |
| Win+T      | Launch taskmgr                       |
| Win+S      | Launch or focus Slack.               |


Futhermore, all `Win+<number>` key combinations are disabled. Who even uses this??


## Help
I attempted to run the PowerToys Runner when pressing the Windows button without any other combination, but I just couldn't get it to work properly. I know it's possible, but the AutoHotkey syntax is painful for people like me. If you have a script for this, please let me know by creating a pull-request. I will be eternally grateful.
